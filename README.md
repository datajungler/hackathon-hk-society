# hk-society
It is a projects run in Open Data Hackathon 2017 in Hong Kong.
The original idea is generated by Brian Leung.
Other teammates Horace Tang and Jason Lam contribute the part of data processing and visualization.

We wish to open source this project to:
Build up a database storing more informative attributes/dimension based on the existing open data
Analyze the relationship between the Hong Kong society
Visualize the society in forms of their nature
Recommendation to citizens which societies they are suitable to join
